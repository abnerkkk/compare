- de: excellent but generally slow. In the original paper on J. Global Opt. it shows thousands of iterations to get
  to the global optimum. Nice that it handles all types of mixed-integer constraints and variables.
- de+smt: way the best combination I have tried, works best even if smt samples with ridicolous small hypercube like 3*ndim.
  it is important that smt uses 'pow_exp' as it seems to massively improve throughput fitting
- cobyla: excellent, but it does not handle eq constraints and integer variables. on a sample instance it failed to converge once.
- slsqp: excellent, extremely fast, again it does not handle integer variables and it's expensive due to the Jacobian
- ego: interesting, handles integer and categorical variables but very slow despite being surrogate based and oddily
  returns infeasible solutions
- openbox: seemed interesting but started to give unclear warnings on the benchmark problems
- nevergrad: does not seem well designed to handle constraints. NGO and Cobyla have been found in some studies to be among the best
  in real-valued optimization, with NGO better with more variables
- opytimizer: seems quite fast but the implementations appear possibly simplistic, but it does not handle constraints
